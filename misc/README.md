> various tools for building needed server files.

## About

Fixing some of the things without access to Strasburg's servers is more easily accomplished by just creating the necessary data file and serving it yourself from your own server.

## Tools

### `nph-aladin.pl` shim

`nph-aladin.py` generates a properly formatted JSON with https links from data available from http servers and saves it in `data/nph-aladin.json`.

An https-served version for production is available [here](https://laniakean.com/data/nph-aladin.json).
